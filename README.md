# mateclient

> A Multi-Agent Testing Environment client side implementation.

Before you run it make sure to run server side (available in a separate repo)
at localhost:3000 because client devServer proxies to that address

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
